关于《文言章句》
文言文与现代中文（白话文）有较大差别，却是现代中文的源头，与现代中文
有著密切的源与流的关系。
文言文是以先秦口语为基础而形成的古代书面语、以及后代仿照先秦作品写成
的书面语言。魏晋以后，特别是晚唐五代以后，文言文与当时的实际口语已有了相
当大的差别。文言在中国行时久远，它不反映方言，通行南北。经由历代文人加工
锤炼，将汉语及中国文字的特点，如声韵、节奏、对仗、意蕴发挥到了极致。优美
的古诗文，是中华传统文化的瑰宝。
中国学生从小学一年级就开始接触古文、古诗。中、小学十二年语文教学中，
文言所占比例超过三分之一。这对学生提高语文理解、表述能力，提高语文欣赏水
平有很重要的作用。
中文作为第二语言的教学，学生在学习一两年以后，必须开始接触书面语，文
言文知识欠缺的问题便渐渐凸显。现代中文的诸多词汇来源于文言。就连初级中文
中最基本的句型如“所以”、“其实”、“然而”等等都来自文言，而且意义上也
无区别。更不用说大量的书面语，以及成语、典故、警策之句了。文言与现代中文
语法的基本结构相同，文言句法在现代中文时有所见。像文言中较为特殊的“使
“，中中“““，““
是使人吃惊；“美容”是使容貌美丽。更有不少文章援引古诗古文。典范的现代规
范美文融合了“文”、“白”各自的优势，体现了古今并存的特点。现代中文，回
避不了文言，随著教育水平和文化水准的提高，文言对现代中文口语、书面语的影
响更为明显。
学习中文的外国学生，在高年级必须学习一些文言文。文言文教学应该成为中
文教学的组成部分。以使学习者对现代中文的源流有所了解，知其所以然，加深理
解。学习者在学习文言文的同时，会自然而有效地提高现代中文水平。
以词汇语义为中心，是适应中文特点语言教学法。现代中文教学如此，文言教
学更是如此。王力先生指出，“古汉语的问题，主要是词汇问题”，只有理解词义
才能理解语意。特别是文言中的虚词，人们用“之乎者也”称代文言，足见其在文
言文中的重要性。这些虚词数量不多而使用频繁，用法灵活，掌握这些虚词是读懂
文言文的钥匙。这些虚词，几乎保留着其原有的形态进入现代，活跃在现代语言
中。
我们曾对美国学生教授文言文，而苦于没有合宜的教材。一般现有教材，多用
“文选”的方式。但是文言选文，并不能涵盖文言词义的不同用法，不易归纳其规
律和特点。也不能顾及常用字、常用句型。篇什中还时有冷僻的词语和不多见的句
言及现代中文的阅读理解能力。
本教材则不再采用“文选”方式，而用语录体。选取典型文言例句，将虚词、
固定格式、特殊语法归纳成组，综合说解。此为经线。每个例句有词语的注释，多
ii
--- Page 5 ---
iv
为实词，此为横向扩展的纬线。我们希望以这些词语构成经纬，使学习者由此而获
得初步的文言阅读能力。并将古今用法加以比较，以知晓源流。以今释古，以古例
今，沟通古今。
和现代中文一样，文言词语也有字频的问题，常用字远比非常用字少。无论虚
字还是实字，文言文中古代使用频率较高和古今通用的，大约只有一千多字（现代
中文的甲、乙级常用字有一千六百余字）。相比之下，对于外国学生来说，文言文
的学习和理解应该不比现代中文难。这和中国学生觉得文言文远比现代中文难学是
完全不同的。选择例句时，尽量选用常用字构成的语句，避免冷僻的非常用字。文
言词语灵活多义，只能说明其主要的意义和用法，并未涵盖全部。细致而全面的详
解既无必要也无意义。
除了词语的典型性，选择例句还适当注意到历史文化内容及意思的完整。摘弓
自经史子集等各种文体，使学习者扩展眼界，引起兴趣。一些警策之句则有记忆背
诵的价值。
这些章句，已经不是一般意义上的、只为彰显个别字词的单句。除了有例释字
词的功能，又可代替文选的作用。如引自《国策·触龙说赵太后》中的“.…．‘老
能。’太后之色少解。”旨在例释文言文中的“程度副词”。句中出现了“殊”、
“少”、“益”三个程度副词，宜于说解和比较，提高再现率。而且章句段落的意
义也比较清楚。
作为练习，另有若干例句，也都摘自古诗文，刊于正文之后。学习者在学习该
课之后应能自行读懂而无大的障碍。每课后，附有一两篇文选，文字上略有改动，
并加注释。作为文选阅读练习。
本书有二十二课。每课二十余段，总计语句有436段。总量超过一般文选式
的课文。共有词语将近2000，包括了大部分文言常用词语。
章句及词语有中英文注释，对应的白话文释文。因此，本书既可作为文言文课
程的教材，也作为自学的教材或文言读物。
本教材建议用于学过三年以上中文的学习者。每课可用3-4学时。
北京师范大学中文系教授、国学及书法大师启功先生为本书的编写提出过很好
的建议，并题写了书名。书未编就而先生已逝，仅以此书作为对先生的纪念。

FOREWORD
What Is Classical Chinese?
Classical Chinese is the language of works written prior to the Qin dynasty (221-206
BCE) and during the time extending through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), in
other words, the period roughly from the eighth century BCE to the third century CE.
 Scholars generally agree that this written language was based on the spoken language of
pre-Qin times. In general reference, the term classical Chinese also includes the literary
language of later periods which was written in imitation of the language of pre-Qin works.
An alternative term, literary Chinese is a more direct translation of the Chinese term
of just what is meant by “classical." However, for most purposes, the two terms can be
used interchangeably, referring to the style of language that was used in almost all written
communication right up until the May Fourth Movement that began in 1919. The Chinese
contexts. A somewhat similar situation exists in Chinese language usage, in that the terms
wenyan and wenyanwen are sometimes used more or less interchangeably with guwen,
technically, “ancient writing.
 pre-Qin form and indeed developed into many different local dialects. However, scholars
and poets continued to imitate the forms and styles of the classical written language, and
thus this classical, or literary language changed very slowly and in only minor ways
Classical Chinese In Contemporary Education in China
Beginning in the first grade Chinese children are introduced to classical prose and
poetry, and through the twelve years of elementary and secondary school such works ac-
count for more than one-third of their educational curriculum. This is very important in
improving their ability to understand and express themselves, as well as their overall ap-
preciation for the language.
In Chinese Language Programs for Foreign Students
In a program in Chinese as a second language, after students have studied one or two
years they must begin to learn written forms of the language, and from that point on, lack
of knowledge of classical Chinese becomes an increasingly prominent problem. Much of
the vocabulary of modern Chinese comes directly from the classical language. Even in an
elementary Chinese course such basic sentence-forming elements as 所以，其实 and 然
M come from classical Chinese, and indeed still carry the same meaning as in the literary
language. Even more striking are the large amounts of modern written Chinese vocabu-
lary, along with idioms, allusions, maxims and other figures of speech, that derive direct-
ly from the classical language. Basic grammatical patterns of modern and classical Chi-
nese are also very similar, with classical constructions often appearing in the modern lan-
guage. Such special grammatical features from classical Chinese as causative and puta-
tive verbs, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs, also occasionally appear in the mod-
ern language. Thus 惊人 means “to cause someone to feel startled,” and 美容 means “to
V

passages from classical poetry and prose. Exemplary contemporary writing merges the
outstanding features of literary and vernacular language and exhibits the excellence of the
two styles in combination. Modern Chinese cannot be detached from the classical lan-
guage. As the educational and cultural levels among the Chinese rise, the influence of
classical Chinese on the modern spoken and written language becomes ever more appar-
ent.
Thus the teaching of classical Chinese should be an integral component of a Chinese
language program for foreign students so that the students will understand the develop-
ment of the language and have a deeper appreciation for it. As they study the classical
language their level of competence in the modern language will naturally and concurrent-
ly improve.
The Importance of Vocabulary, Especially Function Words
 Pedagogy that focuses on vocabulary and meaning takes advantage of the special
characteristics of the Chinese language. This is true in the teaching of modern Chinese
and even more important in classical Chinese instruction. The renowned linguist Wang Li
王力 said, “The problems of classical Chinese are primarily problems of vocabulary."
One can understand a passage only if one understands the vocabulary of that passage.
This is especially true of the function words of classical Chinese. The frequent use of the
phrase “之乎平者也” (simply a recitation of four of the most prominent of these function
words) to refer to the classical language reflects the importance of this category of terms
to the language. These function words are relatively few in number but occur with great
frequency and are used very flexibly, and control of them is thus the key to understanding
classical Chinese. Most of these terms survive today with very little change in their form
and are very much alive in the modern language.
Those of us who teach classical Chinese to American students have often com-
plained about the scarcity of appropriate teaching materials. Most existing textbooks fol-
low the principle of “selected readings." However, a selection of classical Chinese read-
ings cannot easily encompass the variety of uses of important vocabulary items and pro-
vide a clear focus on their most pertinent characteristics. Nor can such a selection deal
adequately with high frequency vocabulary and sentence patterns. The selections are also
likely to include rare or obscure terms and seldom seen sentence patterns. Students might
remember the stories but fail to remember the important words and phrases and thus be
unable to make appropriate deductions when reading other materials so as to continually
improve their ability to read and understand modern Chinese.
Therefore we have set aside the “selected readings” format in favor of what might be
called an “excerpts style."We select typical example sentences and somewhat longer ex-
cerpts, gathering function words, fixed phrases and special syntactic forms into groups
for explanation. This becomes the warp that holds the fabric together, while individual
sentences with glosses on their vocabularymostly content words—serve as the woof
that completes the tapestry. Our hope is that this interwoven fabric will provide students
with a basic ability to read classical Chinese. In addition, the comparisons of classical and
   s   ss  os  n

vii
forms from ancient to modern. Using the contemporary language to explain the classical
language, while the classical is reflected in the modern, should provide a connection be-
tween the classical and the contemporary forms of the language.
TheImportance of Focus on High FrequencyVocabulary
In classical just as in modern Chinese, frequency of occurrence of vocabulary items
is an important aspect of language study. High frequency words are much fewer in num-
ber than low frequency words. With function words and content words taken together,
there are probably not much more than a thousand characters that occur with high fre-
quency in classical Chinese and still carry their original meaning in modern Chinese.
（The《汉语水平词汇与汉字等级大纲》's A and B lists of high frequency characters in
 modern Chinese total just over 1,600.) Thus in relative terms the study of classical Chi-
nese should not be more difficult for foreign students than modern Chinese. This contra-
dicts the feling of Chinese students that the classical language is much more difficult
than the modern language. In selecting example sentences we have tried to choose sen-
tences constructed from high frequency vocabulary and avoid rare or obscure low fre-
quency characters. Given the flexibility and polysemy of much classical vocabulary, we
have not tried to give complete explanations of all possible meanings of a term but have
only explained each vocabulary item's principal meaning and usage. Complete and de-
tailed explanations are unnecessary and not really meaningful in the context of this ma-
terial.
Careful Selection of ExampleSentences and Excerpts
 In selecting example sentences, in addition to focusing on typical vocabulary, we
have tried to choose examples that have historical and cultural value and that express a
complete thought. These examples have been taken from the traditional categories of
Chinese writings—the classics, history, the philosophers and literary writings—in order
to open new vistas for students and arouse their interest. (See “Sources" on pp. 219-220
for a list of our sources with the number of examples from each work or author.) Some of
the especially pithy sentences are well worth memorizing.
Our selections are more than ordinary excerpts selected to display given vocabulary
and sentence patterns. Aside from serving as examples of vocabulary usage, they also
take the place of “selected readings." For example, the brief dialogue from the Intrigues
of the Warring States that stands as item no. 14 in Lesson 17 is introduced to exemplify
classical Chinese adverbs of degree, and within this one short passage the three adverbs
of degree 殊'very', 少 'slightly' and 益 'increasingly' all appear, enhancing explanation
and comparison and improving the chances of recognition of these terms when they reap-
pear in other writings. Furthermore, the segmentation and flow of meaning in the piece is
quite clear.
To help students apply what they have learned in the main section of each lesson, we
have included, in the Exercises sections, a number of additional practice sentences drawn
from classical works of poetry and prose. And the final section of each lesson consists of
one or two selected readings that have in some cases been slightly revised from the origi-
nal and annotated. We hope that students can read and understand these practice sen-
tences and selections are provided in the Key to Exercises at the back of the book; how-
--- Page 9 ---

ever, students should not look at the “Key" until after they have written out their own
translations.
The twenty-two lessons of the book include a total of 436 example sentences and
longer excerpts. Glossed vocabulary totals approximately 2000 terms, most of which are
high frequency classical words.
Example sentences are accompanied by Chinese and English glosses, and key voca-
bulary and grammatical functions introduced in each lesson are explained in both Chinese
and English. Therefore, this book is not only appropriate for classroom instruction but
can also be used for self instruction or as independent reading material in classical Chi-
nese. (See the following note for additional information on lesson structure and conven-
tions.)
Recommended Prerequisite Study and Classroom Use
This textbook is recommended for use with students who have had at least three
years of Chinese language instruction, but it can also be used by students with a strong
foundation acquired through two years of prior study in a rigorous program. Each lesson
can be completed in three to four hours of instruction.
Authorship
The work of preparing this textbook was divided as follows: Kai Li is responsible for
conception of the book, selection and arrangement of the example excerpts, writing the
Chinese definitions and grammatical notes in each lesson, initial preparation of lesson
glossaries, and writing the modern Chinese translations of the classical excerpts. James
Dew wrote the English translations of definitions and grammatical notes, did a fair
amount of editing of the lesson glossaries-especially as regards the English glosses-
did the final editing and formatting of the book, and prepared the vocabulary index. We
express our gratitude to Vivian Ling for corrections and useful suggestions and for her
expertise in the initial formatting of the lessons.
Dedication
This book is dedicated to the late Professor 启功 Qi Gong of Beijing Normal Uni-
versity's Chinese Department. Professor Qi, who was a renowned sinologist and calli-
grapher, offered excellent suggestions regarding the writing of this textbook, and the title
that appears on the cover and title page of the book is in his hand.

LESSON STRUCTURE AND CONVENTIONS
1. Lesson Structure
Each lesson begins with an introduction of key vocabulary items and grammatical
functions, explained in Chinese and English. This is followed by illustrative example sen-
tences excerpted from classical—and a very few modern—sources. Each excerpt is fol-
lowed by a brief glossary of vocabulary items that a student might not know from pre-
vious study of three years of modern Chinese, with the key term or terms for the lesson
highlighted with the → symbol. Following this small glossary, each sentence is translated
into modern Chinese.
It should be noted that in many cases these translations are written in a rather formal
style of modern Chinese, to some extent retaining the word order and diction of the clas-
sical excerpts rather than being phrased in the most colloquial variety of modern Chinese
We hope that this style of translation will help the student see the relationship between
the classical and modern forms of the language.
A second section, designated 练习, or Exercises, provides additional example sen-
tences illustrating the key vocabulary and grammatical structures of the lesson. These
authors hope that on the basis of what students have learned from the first part of the les-
son, they can understand, explain and translate these examples without immediate refer-
ence to translations. However, translations are included in the Key to Exercises at the end
of the book so that students can check their understanding after writing out their own
translations.
A final 阅读, or Readings, subsection of the Exercises is designed to function in a
way similar to the preceding excerpts, though it consists of one or two somewhat longer
pieces of connected text and thus is seen as providing more interesting reading than what
has preceded. The text for each Reading selection actually appears twice, first as a com-
plete, uninterrupted text, then broken into one or two-sentence segments for glossing.
These reading selections are also translated in the Key at the end of the book.
The original source is given for all excerpts and reading selections. Occasionally,
slight revisions have been made in the reading selections in order to avoid abstruse termi-
nology that might distract students from the focus of the lesson material.
2. Glossing Conventions
 In the lesson glossaries, words—and a few longer locutions—-are given first in Chi-
nese characters, followed by pinyin romanization, a modern Chinese gloss and an English
gloss. Romanization is given even for relatively basic terms in order to facilitate conve-
nient use of the alphabetical vocabulary index. Students should take note of the pronun-
ciation of even seemingly familiar terms, as there are a few terms whose pronunciation in
classical Chinese differs from modern Chinese, and some terms have varying readings for
different meanings. In most cases the Chinese and English glosses are synonymous or
supplementary to one another. However, the omission of a Chinese gloss usually means
that the glossed term is also used in modern Chinese and a "translation" from classical to
ix
--- Page 11 ---
modern Chinese is therefore unnecessary. English glosses are often omitted when the
dent does not need a corresponding English gloss.
Generally a term is glossed only on its first occurrence. However, when a term that
has been glossed appears in a new meaning, it is given a new gloss. And in a very few
cases a gloss is repeated, as a reminder to the student, even though it is not new. For ex-
ample, 去, followed by a place name and meaning leave, go away from' is glossed twice
because this usage is quite the opposite of its usual modern Chinese meaning, 'go to'. This
procedure of providing a gloss only for the first occurrence of a term is likely to result in
students occasionally encountering a term whose meaning they have forgotten since an
earlier encounter. In such a case, a quick look at the vocabulary index will take them to
the earlier lesson where the term was glossed.
As noted in the Foreword, we have not attempted to give complete explanations of
all possible meanings of any given term but have tried to provide simple glosses appro-
priate to the given context. Perusal of dictionaries for additional information is always
recommended.

第十课：兼词
兼词，又称兼性词，即一个词同时兼有两种词性。兼词一般是合音字，
是经常连用的两个词，快读而形成的。这类兼词在文言中并不多，主要
有诸、、焉、耳、尔、巨等。
现代汉语中也有这类词，如“俩”（两个）、“仁”（三个）、“甬”
（不用）等。
There are a few terms in classical Chinese that are contractions, or phonetic fusions,
of two words. These terms, known in Chinese as 兼词 jianci, or "dual function
words," derive from two words which frequently spoken together in rapid speech
have coalesced into one word. These fusions continue to carry the grammatical
functions of both of the original words that coalesced to form them. There are a li-
mited number of such terms in classical Chinese, such as 诸, (hé),焉,耳,尔 and
回 (po).
Colloquial modern Mandarin also contains a few such fused words, for example, 俩
lia, 仁 sa and  béng (from 两个,三个 and 不用 respectively).
一、“诸”是合音词。
诸(zhu)，是“之乎”、“之于”的合音词，兼有这两个词的词性。
诸 is a fusion of 之乎 or 之于, and it combines the functions of the parts of speech of
its two component words.
甲、“之乎”：“之”是代词，“乎”是语气词。一般用在句末。
